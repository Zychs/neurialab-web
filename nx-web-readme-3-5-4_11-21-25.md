# NEURIALAB · Web Surface v3.5.4  
### *Lighthouse Centroid · Private README*  
**Classification:** Internal · Not for Public Release  
**Disclosure Level:** Zero operational details

---

## ❖ Overview  
Neurialab Web v3.5.4 is the **lighthouse centroid**—a single-surface HTML prototype that blends the narrative glow of the early Lighthouse builds with the structural discipline of the v3 Portal.

It is:
- a **signal**, not the system,  
- a **surface**, not the engine,  
- a **front-facing lens**, not the tower behind it.

This version exists to show **direction**, not implementation.

---

## ❖ Purpose of This Surface  
This file acts as:

- a conceptual **orientation point** for Neurialab’s broader ecosystem  
- a **style anchor** for future UI layers  
- a **visual scaffold** for collaborators  
- a **non-disclosing public-safe prototype**

All deep mechanics—cognitive models, phase-metrics, semantic routing, recursive operators—remain entirely absent by design.

---

## ❖ What Is Contained  
**v3.5.4 includes:**

- Lighthouse-inspired hero section  
- Breadcrumb lineage of v1 → v3.2  
- Miniature Codex preview (static sample doctrines)  
- Blog strip placeholders  
- Contact surface with updated *NCD* focus  
- Global kerning + spacing refinements  
- Polished modal, grid, and tower-card motifs  
- Fully contained CSS (no external assets required)

Everything is self-contained in a **single HTML document**.

---

## ❖ What Is *Not* Contained  
To preserve non-disclosure:

- No cognitive-phase algorithms  
- No semantic OS internals  
- No journaling-device protocols  
- No routing logic  
- No inversion metrics  
- No behavioral geometry computations  
- No AJD hardware details  
- No research data, no formulas, no operators

This document is *purely aesthetic + structural*.

## ❖ Deployment (Private)  
To host safely—**without exposing protected material**—you may:

- run locally  
- deploy behind VPN  
- password-protect via htpasswd  
- store on private IPFS  
- host in unindexed Neocities or static server  
- embed in private application demos

This version is safe for limited exposure because it contains **zero proprietary content**.

Future versions may not be.

## ❖ Editing Guide  
The HTML includes internal section anchors:

```html
<!-- HERO -->
<!-- BREADCRUMBS -->
<!-- MINI CODEX GRID -->
<!-- BLOG PREVIEW -->
<!-- CONTACT STRIP -->
<!-- MODAL -->
These are organizational beacons, not disclosures.

When editing:

Adjust aesthetics freely

Avoid inserting protected methods

Keep the modal + grid architecture intact if preserving structure

Treat this file as the “front room” of Neurialab

❖ Notes on v3.5.4
Refinements added:

global typography smoothing

reduced border opacity

lighthouse beam polish

updated contact vector

unified NCD framing

modal clarity upgrades

smoother gradients + ambient glow corrections

Removed or protected:

anything resembling operational theory

any cognitive dynamics explanations

all internal architectures

all system-layer schemas

This version is safe by absence, not obfuscation.

❖ Intended Audience
This page is for:

you

trusted reviewers

close collaborators

people evaluating aesthetics and direction

preliminary portfolio contexts

Not suitable for:

academia

investors requesting technical detail

patent filings

research validation

It is aesthetic first, structural second, strictly non-technical.

❖ Closing Note
v3.5.4 is the beam, not the tower.
The deeper corpus remains elsewhere—unshared, unindexed, and unforked.

This surface is the invitation, not the revelation.

For any additional internal documents (CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE_PRIVATE.txt, DEPLOY_PRIVATE.md, or a collaborator onboarding doc), just ask and they’ll be generated in matching aesthetic style.
