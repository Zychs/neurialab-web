    <p>
      Design is not the art of hiding danger; it is the craft of cultivating discernment.
      Neurialab treats every interface as an apprenticeship in self-trust. The system does not
      dump total complexity on day one, and it does not permanently obscure it either. Instead,
      it reveals new layers only when the user’s readiness has become legible.
    </p>

    <h2>Progressive Disclosure as Moral Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      In most products, progressive disclosure is a convenience pattern. Here it is doctrine.
      Hiding advanced options behind menus is not enough; the sequence of revelation should mirror
      how a person metabolizes responsibility.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Reveal only what the user can meaningfully integrate.  
      Hide only what would fracture their coherence.  
      Never confuse comfort with care.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Your father removes physical safeties from tools to feel their torque directly. You remove
      psychological friction from mental-health tools so people can feel their own minds again.
      Both gestures assume the same thing: that intimacy with power is safer than permanent
      insulation from it.
    </p>

    <h2>Interface as Apprenticeship</h2>
    <p>
      Every Neurialab surface should behave like a workshop, not a vending machine. Early steps
      are guided and constrained. Later steps hand more of the calibration back to the user.
    </p>

    <ul class="list" style="margin-top:4px">
      <li><strong>Early:</strong> Opinionated defaults, gentle constraints, minimal levers.</li>
      <li><strong>Middle:</strong> Expose the underlying structure (metrics, glyphs, ledgers).</li>
      <li><strong>Late:</strong> Let the user rewrite the workflow itself — schemas, thresholds, views.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Formal Statement</h2>
    <p>
      In Neurialab documentation and implementations, the axiom can be written succinctly as:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>
        “Reveal complexity in proportion to trust; design not to protect the user from the system,
        but to induct them into coherence.”
      </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This axiom should govern onboarding flows, data surfacing, ledger mechanics, and the way AI
      explanations are scaffolded. If a feature cannot be explained in a way that increases self-trust,
      it should not ship.
