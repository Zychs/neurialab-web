    <p>
      In every motion, the body sings. Thought is not confined to neurons; it ripples through fascia,
      breath, posture, and the gravitational relationships you inhabit. Bodily Resonant Cymatic
      Cognition Theory (BRCC) frames cognition as a resonant event — a pattern of coherence between
      neural, muscular, and environmental oscillations.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The body is not a vessel for the mind; it is the resonant architecture that lets minds happen.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Where classical models treat “mind” as symbolic processing in a sealed skull, BRCC takes a more
      cymatic stance: experience is the standing wave formed when internal dynamics meet external
      fields. Keyboard rhythm, gait, vocal timbre, and micro-gestures are all part of the same
      pattern language.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Lives as a Fragment</h2>
    <p>
      BRCC is intentionally stored as a White Fragment rather than a polished doctrine. It is a probe:
      a way of treating movement data, typing patterns, and even gameplay traces as candidates for
      cognitive resonance mapping, without pretending the theory is finished.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Principles of BRCC</h2>
    <p>
      BRCC posits that cognition emerges from vibrational patterns across bodily systems. Drawing from cymatics—the study of 
      visible sound and vibration—it suggests that thoughts form like sand patterns on a vibrating plate, shaped by frequencies 
      from brain waves, heartbeat, and environmental noise.
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Resonance as Integration:</strong> Neural firings resonate with muscular tensions, creating coherent "thought forms" that manifest as ideas or emotions.</li>
      <li><strong>Cymatic Mapping:</strong> Audio inputs (voice, music) and physical movements create wave interference, influencing cognitive states.</li>
      <li><strong>Bodily Architecture:</strong> Fascia and skeletal structures act as resonators, amplifying or dampening signals to shape perception.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Evidence and Correlations</h3>
    <p>
      Empirical hints abound: EEG studies show brain waves syncing with rhythmic activities like walking or drumming. In Neurialab 
      experiments, users exhibit heightened insight during sessions with aligned audio feedback, suggesting cymatic reinforcement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider vocal timbre: a trembling voice might indicate dissonant resonance between emotional intent and physical expression, 
      fracturing coherence. BRCC tools could map these to glyphs, offering real-time tuning.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Cognition is not computation; it is symphony—waves in harmony or discord.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Applications in Reflexive Systems</h2>
    <p>
      In Neurialab, BRCC informs cymatic integration layers. For example, transcript engines could overlay audio spectrograms with 
      linguistic features, revealing how pitch modulations correlate with semantic shifts. Future prototypes might use wearables to 
      capture postural data, folding it into the Reflexive Field for holistic self-tracking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Challenges include quantifying "resonance" without reductive metrics and ensuring ethical use of bodily data. Yet, BRCC opens 
      doors to systems where healing happens through tuned vibrations, aligning body and mind in reflexive harmony.
    </p>

    <h2>Open Questions and Probes</h2>
    <p>
      As a fragment, BRCC invites experimentation: How do urban noise fields disrupt cognitive resonance? Can deliberate postures 
      "retune" thought patterns? These probes guide Neurialab's evolution, treating the body as the ultimate interface.
