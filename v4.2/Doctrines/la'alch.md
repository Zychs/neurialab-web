Below is a **clean, production-ready, audit-friendly README.md** you can drop straight into your repo.
It’s written in a **neutral, professional engineering tone**, not my playful persona tone.
It reflects everything you specified: anonymity, memoryless architecture, reproducible builds, cryptographic verification, and open-source transparency.

# **Alchemical Prodex**

*A 144-operator cognitive engine for clarity-based recovery and group reflection.*
**Web-first • 100% client-side • Zero storage • Auditable • Reproducible • Cross-platform via Capacitor**

---

## **Overview**

The Alchemical Prodex is a **144-card digital clarity engine** built from a
**12 × 12 matrix** of:

* **12 Clarities** (Perception → Agency)
* **12 Doctrines** (internal operators)

Each card represents a unique cognitive prompt that can be used in:

* **Solo Mode** (single-user, ephemeral)
* **Meeting Mode** (group circle, device-passing or temporary shared session)

The Prodex is designed to be:

* **Fully anonymous**
* **Non-archival**
* **Stateless**
* **Self-contained**
* **Web-first** with iOS/Android portability via Capacitor

This project intentionally **stores no user data** and includes **no tracking**, **no accounts**, **no logging**, and **no persistence** of any kind.

---

## **Core Principles**

### **1. Zero Data Retention**

The Prodex never writes user data to:

* localStorage
* indexedDB
* cookies
* server logs
* analytics systems

All session information exists **only in RAM** and is wiped when the user:

* leaves the page
* refreshes
* closes the app
* kills the PWA

### **2. Fully Client-Side**

The application:

* loads static assets only
* performs all logic in the browser
* makes no network calls after initial load

### **3. Auditable Source**

All logic is transparent:

* The full source is included in this repository.
* All card definitions are stored in simple JSON files.
* The build process is minimal and documented for reproducibility.

### **4. Reproducible Builds**

Each release includes:

* a tarball/zip of the built `dist/` directory
* SHA256 hash of the archive
* optional GPG-signed Git tags

Users can:

* clone the repo
* checkout the release tag
* run the documented build steps
* compare hashes with the published archive

### **5. Cross-Platform via Capacitor**

The Prodex is written as a **web app first**.
Native apps for iOS and Android are generated by wrapping the PWA with Capacitor.

## **Installation**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurialab/alchemical-prodex.git
cd alchemical-prodex
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be in `dist/`.

---

## **Reproducible Build Instructions**

See `REPRODUCIBLE-BUILD.md` for full details.
Summary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurialab/alchemical-prodex.git
cd alchemical-prodex
git checkout v0.1.0

npm ci
npm run build

tar -czf prodex-mybuild-v0.1.0.tar.gz dist/
sha256sum prodex-mybuild-v0.1.0.tar.gz
```

Compare the resulting SHA256 hash with the one published in the corresponding GitHub Release.

---

## **Security Model**

Detailed in `SECURITY.md`.

Key guarantees:

* No trackers
* No analytics
* No third-party libraries that phone home
* No state persistence
* No telemetry
* No networking after initial load

Users are encouraged to audit:

* uses of `fetch()`
* any calls to `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `indexedDB`, or Cookies
* service worker caching behavior
* dependencies listed in `package.json`

If any persistence or external calls appear, it is considered a **security bug**.

---

## **Privacy Guarantee**

As described in `PRIVACY.md`:

* The Prodex is **memoryless**.
* The Prodex keeps **no history**.
* Closing the app erases all session data.
* No data leaves the device.
* No user identity is collected, stored, or inferred.

This matches the anonymity tradition of recovery circles, without requiring any affiliation with existing fellowships.

---

## **Usage**

### **Solo Mode**

* Draw a card
* Reflect on the prompt
* Close the app → all data is deleted

### **Meeting Mode**

* Group gathers in a circle
* Device is passed, or devices sync via temporary RAM-only shared codes
* Each person draws a card during their turn
* No notes, no logs, no transcripts
* Meeting dissolves automatically on exit

### **Grid View (144 Matrix)**

* Full 12 × 12 matrix of Clarity × Doctrine
* Cards are browsable and readable
* No interaction is stored

---

## **Platform Support**

### **Web**

Runs in any modern browser.

### **PWA**

Installable on:

* iOS
* Android
* macOS
* Windows

### **Native Wrappers**

Generate with Capacitor:

```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
npx cap copy
npx cap open ios
npx cap open android
```

---

## **Development Philosophy**

The Alchemical Prodex is intentionally:

* small
* transparent
* predictable
* inspectable
* offline-first
* anti-metric
* anti-surveillance

It is designed as a **cognitive ritual instrument**, not an app that captures or analyzes user behavior.

---

## **License**

MIT or Apache 2.0 recommended.
Select at your discretion.

---

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome, but must adhere to:

* no-persistence rule
* no-telemetry rule
* no-networking rule
* reproducible build constraints
* security and privacy guarantees

Pull requests that introduce data retention or external calls will be rejected.

---

If you want, I can also generate:

* `PRIVACY.md`
* `SECURITY.md`
* `REPRODUCIBLE-BUILD.md`
* The initial `index.html` / `app.js` scaffolding
* The full JSON for clarities, doctrines, and the first 12 cards

Just tell me the next piece you want generated.
