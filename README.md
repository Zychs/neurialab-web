# NEURIALAB · Web Surface v3.5.4  
### *Lighthouse Centroid · Private README*  
**Classification:** Internal · Not for Public Release  
**Disclosure Level:** Zero operational details

---

## ❖ Overview  
Neurialab Web v3.5.4 is the **lighthouse centroid**—a single-surface HTML prototype that blends the narrative glow of the early Lighthouse builds with the structural discipline of the v3 Portal.

It is:
- a **signal**, not the system,  
- a **surface**, not the engine,  
- a **front-facing lens**, not the tower behind it.

This version exists to show **direction**, not implementation.

---

## ❖ Purpose of This Surface  
This file acts as:

- a conceptual **orientation point** for Neurialab’s broader ecosystem  
- a **style anchor** for future UI layers  
- a **visual scaffold** for collaborators  
- a **non-disclosing public-safe prototype**

All deep mechanics—cognitive models, phase-metrics, semantic routing, recursive operators—remain entirely absent by design.

---

## ❖ What Is Contained  
**v3.5.4 includes:**

- Lighthouse-inspired hero section  
- Breadcrumb lineage of v1 → v3.2  
- Miniature Codex preview (static sample doctrines)  
- Blog strip placeholders  
- Contact surface with updated *NCD* focus  
- Global kerning + spacing refinements  
- Polished modal, grid, and tower-card motifs  
- Fully contained CSS (no external assets required)

Everything is self-contained in a **single HTML document**.

---

## ❖ What Is *Not* Contained  
To preserve non-disclosure:

- No cognitive-phase algorithms  
- No semantic OS internals  
- No journaling-device protocols  
- No routing logic  
- No inversion metrics  
- No behavioral geometry computations  
- No AJD hardware details  
- No research data, no formulas, no operators

This document is *purely aesthetic + structural*.
