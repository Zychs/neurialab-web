# Neurialab v3 Portal — Project Map (Seed)

This file is the human-readable map that explains how the public-facing portal connects
to the larger Neurialab / Neuralexica ecosystem.

## Scalars

- **Self (S)** — personal field notes, introspective experiments, phenomenology logs.
- **System (Σ)** — Semantic OS, devices, CLIs, and architectures that support reflexive cognition.
- **Governance (G)** — institutional dynamics, alignment interfaces, and stewardship frameworks.
- **Cosmologist (∞)** — large-scale field theories, heliospheric analogies, and cosmological mappings.

These scalars are referenced on `index.html` and inform how you tag and group fragments on `blogs.html`.

## Surfaces

- **Codex landing** — `index.html`
  - Overview of the four scalars.
  - High-level explanation of what Neurialab is and how people should read the work.

- **Blog surfaces** — `blogs.html`
  - Manual index of essays / fragments.
  - Each entry should include a scalar tag and a one-line meta description.

- **Contact surface** — `contact.html`
  - Channels and preferences for outreach.
  - Safe, static entry point for studios, researchers, or collaborators.

## Back-of-house Notes

- This portal is intentionally static to reduce friction while you are still iterating on the theory stack.
- When ready, you can:
  - Replace `blogs.html` with a generator-driven index.
  - Link to preprints, OSF projects, or whitepapers from individual fragment entries.
  - Add versioning or changelog notes directly into this file.

## Change Log

- **v3.0.0 (seed)** — Static portal skeleton with Codex, blog surfaces, and contact page.
